# NFT Marketplace

## Description
An NFT marketplace project built using blockchain technology is a decentralized platform that uses the Ethereum network and its smart contract standard ERC721 to create unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded. The metadata of these NFTs is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a distributed file system that ensures that the information associated with the NFTs is securely and immutably stored. The use of blockchain technology and IPFS provides the NFT marketplace with a secure and transparent infrastructure, making it possible to ensure the authenticity and ownership of the NFTs on the platform. This makes it ideal for a variety of use cases such as digital art, collectibles, gaming items, and more.
