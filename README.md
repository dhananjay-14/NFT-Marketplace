# NFT Marketplace
Welcome to our basic NFT marketplace project, built on Solidity contracts and deployed on the Sepolia testnet. In this endeavor, I have combined the power of blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a user-friendly and functional NFT marketplace. The platform offers a seamless experience for users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs, ensuring security, transparency, and ease of use.

Key Features:

1. Metamask Integration:
Users can securely log in using their Metamask wallet, ensuring their NFT transactions are private and protected.

2. Minting NFTs:
Creators can mint their digital creations into unique NFTs, allowing them to showcase their art, collectibles, and more on the platform.

4. Token Sales:
Users can list their NFTs for sale, providing a marketplace where collectors and enthusiasts can discover, purchase, and own digital art and collectibles.

4. Creator Royalty:
We support creator royalties, ensuring artists receive a portion of the sale price when their NFTs are resold, providing artists with a sustainable revenue stream.

6. IPFS Image Upload:
To maintain a decentralized and efficient approach, we leverage IPFS for secure and distributed image storage. Users can upload images for their NFTs with confidence in data integrity and availability.

To set up the repository and run the marketplace locally, run the below
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OMGWINNING/NFT-Marketplace-Tutorial
cd NFT-Marketplace-Tutorial
npm install
npm start
```
